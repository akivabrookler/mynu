Git Management Rules:

Since we do not have a premium Github account we cannot enforce branch protection. Please follow the following guidelines to make sure we don't fuck up the source code:

DO NOT MAKE ANY PUSHES OR COMMITS TO MAIN!!

Here's what to do instead:
In VS Code clcik on your branch name in the bottom left corner and create a new branch from main. Push your code to that branch. Then create a pull request and let SOMEONE ELSE review the code, and then merge it to main. :)
